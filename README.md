# Newsdata.io API Analysis with Python  

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize students with data retrieval using an API, performing  analysis on the retrieved data, parsing data and automating this process using Postman, Python and Power Automate (or some other platform options).

In this assignment I have utilized Python to work with the Newdata.io API.


## Installation  
You need to have Python installed. In case you don't download and install Python from the official website https://www.python.org/ .

### Newdata.io

The next step will be to install the Newsdata.io Python client library to integrate Newsdata.io API into your Python application. more information can be found at [Newdata.io Python Client](https://newsdata.io/documentation/#client_py)

```
pip install newsdataapi
```

## Necessary Python Libraries  
We utilize the following libraries in this project:  

**Pandas**  
```
pip install pandas
```
**NumPy**  
```
pip install numpy
```

**Matplotlib**
